The project was to build a Health Screening Application to diagnose depression in patients. This is a full stack web application built on Lamp Stack and hosted on the Google Cloud Platform.
The application assumes that the user can be of 2 personas â€“ Doctor (Admin) and Patients.
The design of the application was done on Wireframe.
The backend of the application is built on PHP.
Patients can access the application and fill out their information along with a diagnosis form (CES-D: Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression).
A score is computed and stored on a MySQL Database.
The doctor can view all patient information including the score that identifies the existence or scale of depression.
The application is hosted on the Google Cloud Platform making use of Google Computing Engine.
The LAMP Stack was installed on the cloud from a Bitnami image.
